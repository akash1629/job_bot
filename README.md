# Job Bot: Automated Job Application & Resume Parsing System

A comprehensive Flask-based web application designed to help job seekers automate job applications and resume parsing. The application supports user registration, resume upload, job search (with scraping/simulated data), and scheduled job applications using automated Selenium scripts.

## Overview

The Job Bot project automates several tasks in the job search process. It includes features for:

- **User Management:**  
  Register and log in users, storing details such as email, location, experience, and resume paths.

- **Resume Parsing:**  
  Upload resumes (PDF, DOCX) which are parsed using PDFMiner and spaCy to extract key information such as name, email, and skills.

- **Job Scraping & Search:**  
  Simulate job search based on user criteria (e.g., location, keywords) or integrate with job board APIs.

- **Automated Job Application:**  
  Automate or schedule applications using Selenium and APScheduler to fill out application forms.

- **Database Integration:**  
  Store users, jobs, and application records using SQLAlchemy with a configurable database (SQLite by default).

## Features

- **User Registration & Login:**  
  Basic endpoints for registering and logging in users.

- **Resume Upload & Parsing:**  
  Upload a resume file, which is then parsed to extract key details using spaCy and PDFMiner.

- **Job Search:**  
  Simulated job scraping function that returns dummy jobs based on user location and keyword.

- **Automated Application:**  
  Apply immediately or schedule applications for future dates using APScheduler.  
  Uses Selenium to automate the job application process (placeholder logic).

- **REST API Endpoints:**  
  Endpoints for user registration, login, resume upload, job search, applying to jobs, and checking application status.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework:** Flask
- **Database:** SQLAlchemy with Flask-Migrate (SQLite by default)
- **Scheduling:** APScheduler
- **Web Automation:** Selenium (with headless Chrome)
- **NLP & Parsing:** spaCy, pdfminer, python-docx
- **Security:** Werkzeug (for file security with `secure_filename`)
- **CORS:** Flask-CORS

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job_bot.git
   cd job_bot
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Example `requirements.txt`:*
   ```
   Flask
   Flask-SQLAlchemy
   Flask-Migrate
   Flask-Cors
   pdfminer.six
   python-docx
   spacy
   APScheduler
   selenium
   werkzeug
   ```
   Make sure you have the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) for Selenium.

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - `DATABASE_URL`: (Optional) Your database URL (default is SQLite `job_bot.db`).
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for Flask.
   - `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH`: Path to your ChromeDriver executable.
   - Other variables as needed.

   For example:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
   export CHROMEDRIVER_PATH="/path/to/chromedriver"
   ```

5. **Initialize the Database:**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```
   (Make sure to run `db create_all()` if needed.)

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will start (by default on port 5000). Access the API endpoints via `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **API Endpoints:**

   - **User Registration:**  
     `POST /register`  
     Request JSON: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "secret", "location": "City", "experience": 3 }`

   - **Login:**  
     `POST /login`  
     Request JSON: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "secret" }`

   - **Resume Upload:**  
     `POST /upload_resume` (multipart/form-data, include file in `resume` field and `user_id`)

   - **Job Search:**  
     `GET /search_jobs?user_id=1&keyword=Data`

   - **Apply to Job:**  
     `POST /apply_job`  
     Request JSON: `{ "user_id": 1, "job_id": 2, "schedule_time": "2025-01-20 10:00:00" }` (schedule_time is optional)

   - **Check Application Status:**  
     `GET /application_status?user_id=1`

## Future Enhancements

- **Improve NLP Capabilities:**  
  Integrate more advanced resume parsing (e.g., custom regex for phone numbers) and use additional NLP models for deeper insight.

- **Enhanced Job Scraping:**  
  Replace the dummy job scraping with actual API integration (e.g., Indeed or LinkedIn) or improved scraping while respecting TOS.

- **User Authentication & Security:**  
  Add proper authentication (JWT or OAuth) and secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt).

- **UI/UX Improvements:**  
  Create a dedicated frontend (using a framework like React or Angular) for a more interactive user experience.
